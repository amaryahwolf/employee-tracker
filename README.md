## Installation
To install the application locally, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed, then clone the repository from Github and run the installation script ```npm install```. Connect a [MySQL workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to the application through the index.js file. Create the database in the workbench using the schema.sql file in the db folder then seed the database in the workbench using the seed.sql file in the db folder. Finally use the start script ```node index.js``` to start the application.

## Usage
Use the "up" and "down" arrow keys on the keyboard to toggle the choices including "View all roles", "View all employees", "Add a department", "Add an employee", "Update an employee role", and "Exit the application". After selecting an option using the "enter" key on the keyboard, the user can then view, create and update employees, roles and departments.
